# Techdegree Project 2 - List Filtering and Pagination

For this project I used JavaScript to dynamically add "pages" to the site, in order to create a better user experience. 
With a list of over 50 individuals, scrolling to see the entire list would likely cause the audience to leave as fast 
as possible. 

More functionality to be included:
- Active page class updating as you change pages
- Search bar appended to the site
- Include keyup functionality for better UX
